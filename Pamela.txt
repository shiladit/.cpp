This is something i never intended to write.. but here i am.. maybe i will regret writing such a long emotional rant in a year or two but i dont want it to fade with me. As i said we never know how much time we have left. At this very moment 27th July 2018 , 4AM in the morning these are my exact thoughts.. 

You are the most amazing girl i have ever known. I will never get tired of listening to you, ever..
We all have been chasing a feeling that we want for ourselves. As elusive as it is, i found it in you. It sounds so selfish but only if you knew. While the world sleeps in perfect silence, i keep thinking about you. There are so many things i want to say to you , clamouring to become visible but words probably are not enough..
I dream of a place where we would be together , however complicated it may seem, I dream..
